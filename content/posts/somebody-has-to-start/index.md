And his father's voice seemed to whisper a reply. *Somebody has to start, son. Somebody has to step forward and do what is right, because it is right. If nobody starts, then others cannot follow.*

Dalinar had come to help Kaladin's men, attacking those archers and saving Bridge Four.

*The lighteyes don't care about life,* Lirin had said*. So I must. So we must.*

*So you must....*

Life before death.

*I've failed so often. I've been knocked to the ground and trod upon.*

Strength before weakness.

*This would be death I'd lead my friends to...*

Journey before destination.

*...death, and what is right.*
