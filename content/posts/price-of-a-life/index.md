'What is a man's life worth?' Dalinar asked softly.

'The slavemasters say one is worth about two emerald broams,' Kaladin said, frowning.

Dalinar smiled, wrinkle lines extending from the corners of his eyes.

'Coincidentally, that is the exact value of a Shardblade. So today, you and your men sacrificed to buy me twenty-six hundred priceless lives. And all I had to repay you with was a single priceless sword. I call that a bargain.'
